Create a house item with 100 wood at a heavy workbench.

While holding the house item, click anywhere in the world to place a house.

Currently looking for someone to build better houses for the mod. You will be credited in the mod description.

Houses that I want to add to the mod
- a medium sized house meant for above ground that houses 2 - 3 NPCs
- a large sized house meant for above ground that houses 3 - 5 NPCs

Please note that this is a WIP mod!!!
