While I was building my rectangle houses, someone named Bob joined my world. He said to me "It's okay, the rectangles can't hurt you anymore, for I am here now". He helped me survive, he gave me a shelter, a place to call home. Bob forever changed my life.

This mod adds an NPC named Bob that will immediately join your world and sell you structures that you can place.

This is the first time I actually tried to build something that looks good. Pretty much all structures built by me need a remaster. If you would like to help remaster or build new structures please join the discord. https://discord.gg/j8HQZZ76r8
