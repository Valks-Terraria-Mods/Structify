[h2]A Special Encounter with Bob[/h2]
While I was building my rectangle houses, someone named Bob joined my world. He said to me "It's okay, the rectangles can't hurt you anymore, for I am here now". He helped me survive, he gave me a shelter, a place to call home. Bob forever changed my life.

This mod adds an NPC named Bob that should immediately join your world and sell you structures that you can place. If for some reason he did not join your world on world start, he should join your world the following day.
