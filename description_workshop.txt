[h2]A Special Encounter with Bob[/h2]
While I was building my rectangle houses, someone named Bob joined my world. He said to me "It's okay, the rectangles can't hurt you anymore, for I am here now". He helped me survive, he gave me a shelter, a place to call home. Bob forever changed my life.

This mod adds an NPC named Bob that will immediately join your world and sell you structures that you can place.
